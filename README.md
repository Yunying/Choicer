## Why are we doing this

Make a random choice for your life!

We all spend too much time contemplating about what to do. We are always afraid that we will miss something great by making a choice. But ALL THE TIME, sitting there hesitating is all but useful. "Life is a box of chocolate", why not just accept whatever the fate gives you? Go out, eat great food, meet great people. We can make an awesome life everywhere! 

Stop hesitate. Just go to the website, click the button, and enjoy the sunshine!

Start by adding some restaurants to your list; then just click the button on your homepage!
